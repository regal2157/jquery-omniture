# jQuery Omniture Plugin

Provides a convenient way for developers to add SiteCatalyst/Omniture tracking to pages and DOM elements. This is a modification of Jaime Bueza's plugin. More stripped down, and convienent for my use.

## jQuery Omniture Plugin API

### omniture.view()

Provides the capability to apply pageview metrics to a particular route. This is a facade for <code>s.t()</code>.

* <code>{ String } route</code> - A human readable string representing the location you want tracked. This is a string but gets transformed into a regex.
* <code>{ Function } callback</code> - The callback you want executed that returns the metrics properties and sends them off to SiteCatalyst (Omniture).

### omniture.link()

Provides the capability to execute pseudo synchronous requests (img) to Omniture. This is a facade for <code>s.tl()</code>.

* <code>{ String | DOM Element } element</code> - The targeted node you want to listen to. eg/ $("button") or "#btn-register"
* <code>{ String } event</code> - The event you want to listen to on a particular node. eg/ "click", "hover", "mouseup", "keydown"
* <code>{ Function} callback</code> - The callback you want executed that returns the metrics properties and sends them off to SiteCatalyst (Omniture).

## Example on how to use

<pre>
  $(document).ready(function() {
      
  });
</pre>
